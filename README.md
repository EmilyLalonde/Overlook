Overlook is the final project for mod 2 and it is a hotel management app. I displays information that a viewer may like to see, like: their past bookings, how much they have spent on room service over all time, and interesting day by day statistics about this hotel. This project challenged us to utilize OOP and remain as SRP as possible.
